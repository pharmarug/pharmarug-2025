## Developing Context-Aware AI Coding Assistants for Clinical Data Analysis in R	

Steven Brooks  
Boehringer Ingelheim/Medicine (BDS)	Clinical Data Scientist	

In highly regulated environments where clinical data confidentiality is paramount, traditional AI coding assistants like ChatGPT present two significant challenges: they require data exposure to external systems, and they lack context-specific knowledge of organizational data structures and standards. We present an innovative solution that bridges this gap: a secure, context-aware application that combines large language models (LLMs) with clinical data standards to assist R users in analyzing confidential healthcare data.
Our application, built using PandasAI and Apollo (an internal qualified LLM service) on Microsoft Azure infrastructure, has been trained on our organization's clinical data standards and conventions. This enables it to generate and execute R code that is precisely tailored to our data structures, variable definitions, and analytical requirements. The system can perform various tasks including exploratory data analysis, data quality checks, and the automated generation of tables, figures, and listings.

We will demonstrate how this tool serves dual purposes: accelerating the work of experienced R programmers while simultaneously functioning as an educational platform for R learners working with clinical data. Unlike generic AI coding assistants, our solution provides contextually relevant code suggestions that align with organizational standards and practices, all while maintaining data privacy and regulatory compliance.
This presentation will showcase real-world applications, discuss the technical architecture, and explore how similar systems could be implemented in other organizations working with sensitive data. We'll also address the broader implications for R education and development in regulated industries.

## A Two-Step Framework for Validating Causal Effect Estimates （published in Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety）

沈凌洁	临度医疗科技有限公司

Background: Comparing causal effect estimates obtained using observational data to those obtained from the gold standard (i.e., randomized controlled trials [RCTs]) helps assess the validity of these estimates. However, comparisons are challenging due to differences between observational data and RCT generated data. The unknown treatment assignment mechanism in the observational data and varying sampling mechanisms between the RCT and the observational data can lead to confounding and sampling bias, respectively.

Aims: The objective of this study is to propose a two-step framework to validate causal effect estimates obtained from observational data by adjusting for both mechanisms.

Materials and Methods: An estimator of causal effects related to the two mechanisms is constructed. A two-step framework for comparing causal effect estimates is derived from the estimator. An R package RCTrep is developed to implement the framework in practice (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RCTrep/index.html). 

Results: A simulation study is conducted to show that using our framework observational data can produce causal effect estimates similar to those of an RCT. A real-world application of the framework to validate treatment effects of adjuvant chemotherapy obtained from registry data is demonstrated.

Conclusion: This study constructs a framework for comparing causal effect estimates between observational data and RCT data, facilitating the assessment of the validity of causal effect estimates obtained from observational data.

## Leverage open-source knowledge into statistical validity with validation

Frank Yang	CIMS 

In recent years, R-based approach for clinical trials has rapidly gained attention in the pharmaceutical industry. There are many knowledge resources available, where one can efficiently incorporate those (e.g., {pharmaverse}, {openstatsware} and working groups) into their workflow. The available contribution will include CDISC standard data generation and static and interactive statistical results. Before proceeding on the real practice or automation, one might ask about the validity or reliability of the package, the extent on how we can trust such an approach. In this presentation, we will introduce how to leverage open-sourced R package on internal development with good practice and validated evidence, including preferred package, development cycle, validation method (PHUSE suggested validation framework of {valtools}), and potential usage in pharmaceutical context (e.g., R Shiny, Quarto).

## easeP21: An R tool to ease the Pinnacle 21 review process

Longfei LI/Xing WANG/En WANG/Nana XI	Sanofi		

To address the shortcomings of traditional Pinnacle 21 (P21) reports in terms of precision in issue identification, data integrity, and traceability, we have meticulously crafted an automated tool based on R package and ShinyApp—easeP21. This tool automatically identifies issue types and supplements relevant information based on the P21 reports and associated datasets provided by the user, ultimately generating summary reports (for SDTM and ADAM) and/or data management (DM) reports (only for SDTM) for convenient user access.

easeP21 utilizes P21 validation rules, programming rules, and CDISC IG guidelines to accurately categorize SDTM issues into data issues, programming or metadata issues, and potential false positives. This R tool has reshaped the structure of P21 reports, producing a comprehensive DM report and an all-encompassing summary report for SDTM, while only providing a summary report for ADAM. The DM report focuses on data issues and supplements critical SDTM information, ensuring full traceability of the data. The summary report clearly marks specific issues and links them to validation rules, greatly simplifying the cumbersome process of cross-file review. easeP21 particularly refine the management of split domain issues, precisely delineating them to specific datasets (such as FAAE and FACE), ensuring the continuity and traceability of review conclusions across different versions, thus surpassing the limitations of traditional P21 reports and significantly enhancing the consistency and reliability of the reports.

With its innovative classification technology and the unique data processing capabilities of R, easeP21 has greatly optimized the clinical data review process, offering new insights for clinical trial data management.
