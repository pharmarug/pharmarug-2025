*ABSTRACT* New data types require new tools and methodologies and there is a need in biometrics to respond quickly to understand the ever increasing growth of data generated from clinical trials. In recent years, analysis software tools have taken huge leaps forward. Therefore, we have seized the business opportunity to build an R-based toolkit that will allow us to meet these challenges.

So far, we have open sourced several of our key packages on the Github. Many of our packages are well received by users. I would like to share some of our most recent updates including new open-source packages and tlg-catalog.


### Baseline shiny framework with TIDYTLG
David Fan, Janssen

Yubo (David) Fan is an Associate Director Portfolio Lead at Janssen China R&D. David started his pharmaceutical industry career in 2007 as a Biostatistician in PAREXEL Johnson & Johnson group and joined Janssen China R&D in 2014 as Statistical Programming Manager. Since then, he has grown as a leader with increasing responsibilities and built China CVM statistical programming team starting from April 2017.

Currently David is leading a local team with 11 members and responsible for managing CVM and NS portfolios. With high interest and great passion in R technology, David joined Janssen global R implementation initiative in 2019 and has been serving as the sub-team lead for baseline shiny group from 2021. Under his leadership, shiny sub-team generated the draft version of baseline shiny framework at the end of 2022 and is collaborating with study teams for piloting. David holds a PhD in Epidemiology and Health Statistics from Soochow University.

*ABSTRACT* Open-source technologies have been rapidly growing in recent years, more and more pharmaceutical companies are starting to use R as an alternative to SAS or additional software for clinical trial reporting. To ease the transition for programmers from SAS to R, C&SP group in Janssen R&D developed the tidytlg package for R to create the tables, listings, and graphs (TLG) for clinical study reports. This package has been published to the pharmaverse repository on GitHub.

Baseline Shiny framework is an R package that helps user to create interactive Shiny applications, simply by shuffling around clinical trial data and pre-developed Shiny modules in a yml configuration file. It covers most of the standard safety tables and figures as well as a couple of efficacy modules. In the backend, it depends on tidytlg package for standard tables to keep consistent with static RTF tables based on J&J standard. At the same time, the Shiny App provides more features for users to explore data and get more information from the interactive outputs.

Our presentation will give a brief introduction on the main idea of tidytlg package and mainly focus on baseline Shiny framework with a detailed demo on Shiny App generated based on this framework.

*ABSTRACT* As more and more companies and organizations in pharmaceutical industry are adopting R to their statistical programming process, it is possible that more and more clinical studies and programmers will be utilizing RStudio Project workflow (as demonstrated in Chapter 8 of R4DS). Since every programmer on each team works in their own way, how can we make sure everyone on the team is using the same setting? To help ensure that teams share the same project standards, RStudio offers flexibility, where user can develop (in form of packages) many templates to be shared amongst users on the same team.
This presentation will give a brief introduction to RStudio Project Template and how to create a simple project template from scratch. In addition, will also introduce and review a few different RStudio Project Templates shared by some of the most popular R packages and what we could learn from their design.

Aside from projects, She is enthusiastic about R software and her expertise in R is data visualization.

*ABSTRACT* Finding the root cause of a problem is always challenging. Most bugs are subtle and hard to find because if they were obvious, you wouldâ€™ve avoided them in the first place. A good strategy helps. R comes with a simple set of debugging tools that RStudio amplifies. You can use these tools to better understand code that produces an error or returns an unexpected result.  This topic help beginner on their journey from getting to know the art and science of debugging, starting with a general strategy, then following up with specific tools. we focus specifically on the R debugging tools built into the RStudio IDE; for more general advice on debugging in R (such as philosophy and problem-solving strategies).


### {mmrm}: a robust and comprehensive R package for implementing mixed models for repeated measures
Liming Li, Roche

Liming Li has been a senior data scientist in PD Data Sciences, Roche since 2019. He obtained master degree in biostatistics in Fudan university. He is now the technical engineering lead for chevron product of NEST, and also member of mmrm taskforce of American Statistical Association Biopharmaceutical Section Software Engineering Working Group. In his spare time, he enjoys playing with his cat.

*ABSTRACT* Mixed models for repeated measures (MMRM) analyses have been extensively used in the pharmaceutical industry. Still, a comprehensive and efficient implementation in R has yet to be available, compared to the commercial software SAS. To bridge this gap and move our analysis in the pharmaceutical area to next-gen tools, we decided to develop a new package, `mmrm`, in an open-sourced manner under ASA BIOP SWE working group.
In this session, we will compare the new `mmrm` package, with other current implementations. In addition, we would like to share the experience of this cross-industrial collaboration.
