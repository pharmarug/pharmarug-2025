    "text": "Vue and webR Integration for Serverless Local Statistical Analysis in a Single HTML File\nKaiping Yang BeiGene\nAbstract: This study introduces a pure HTML file constructed using Vue and webR technologies, which enables statistical analysis applications to run locally on users’ environments without the need for an R server. By integrating Vue’s frontend framework with the R language runtime environment provided by webR, we have developed a lightweight solution where users can launch a fully functional local statistical application simply by opening an HTML file. This approach leverages the advantages of modern web technologies, including client-side JavaScript and Vue’s reactive design, to achieve a seamless user interaction and data visualization experience. The research demonstrates how the powerful statistical analysis capabilities of the R language can be combined with Vue’s dynamic user interface, providing statisticians and data scientists with a convenient and efficient working platform. Moreover, this solution significantly reduces the deployment and maintenance costs of statistical analysis software, expanding its application across different environments and user groups.

    "text": "Developing Context-Aware AI Coding Assistants for Clinical Data Analysis in R\nSteven Brooks\nBoehringer Ingelheim/Medicine (BDS) Clinical Data Scientist\nIn highly regulated environments where clinical data confidentiality is paramount, traditional AI coding assistants like ChatGPT present two significant challenges: they require data exposure to external systems, and they lack context-specific knowledge of organizational data structures and standards. We present an innovative solution that bridges this gap: a secure, context-aware application that combines large language models (LLMs) with clinical data standards to assist R users in analyzing confidential healthcare data. Our application, built using PandasAI and Apollo (an internal qualified LLM service) on Microsoft Azure infrastructure, has been trained on our organization’s clinical data standards and conventions. This enables it to generate and execute R code that is precisely tailored to our data structures, variable definitions, and analytical requirements. The system can perform various tasks including exploratory data analysis, data quality checks, and the automated generation of tables, figures, and listings.\nWe will demonstrate how this tool serves dual purposes: accelerating the work of experienced R programmers while simultaneously functioning as an educational platform for R learners working with clinical data. Unlike generic AI coding assistants, our solution provides contextually relevant code suggestions that align with organizational standards and practices, all while maintaining data privacy and regulatory compliance. This presentation will showcase real-world applications, discuss the technical architecture, and explore how similar systems could be implemented in other organizations working with sensitive data. We’ll also address the broader implications for R education and development in regulated industries."

    "text": "A Two-Step Framework for Validating Causal Effect Estimates （published in Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety）\n沈凌洁 临度医疗科技有限公司\nBackground: Comparing causal effect estimates obtained using observational data to those obtained from the gold standard (i.e., randomized controlled trials [RCTs]) helps assess the validity of these estimates. However, comparisons are challenging due to differences between observational data and RCT generated data. The unknown treatment assignment mechanism in the observational data and varying sampling mechanisms between the RCT and the observational data can lead to confounding and sampling bias, respectively.\nAims: The objective of this study is to propose a two-step framework to validate causal effect estimates obtained from observational data by adjusting for both mechanisms.\nMaterials and Methods: An estimator of causal effects related to the two mechanisms is constructed. A two-step framework for comparing causal effect estimates is derived from the estimator. An R package RCTrep is developed to implement the framework in practice (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RCTrep/index.html).\nResults: A simulation study is conducted to show that using our framework observational data can produce causal effect estimates similar to those of an RCT. A real-world application of the framework to validate treatment effects of adjuvant chemotherapy obtained from registry data is demonstrated.\nConclusion: This study constructs a framework for comparing causal effect estimates between observational data and RCT data, facilitating the assessment of the validity of causal effect estimates obtained from observational data."

This tool automatically identifies issue types and supplements relevant information based on the P21 reports and associated datasets provided by the user, ultimately generating summary reports (for SDTM and ADAM) and/or data management (DM) reports (only for SDTM) for convenient user access.\neaseP21 utilizes P21 validation rules, programming rules, and CDISC IG guidelines to accurately categorize SDTM issues into data issues, programming or metadata issues, and potential false positives. This R tool has reshaped the structure of P21 reports, producing a comprehensive DM report and an all-encompassing summary report for SDTM, while only providing a summary report for ADAM. The DM report focuses on data issues and supplements critical SDTM information, ensuring full traceability of the data. The summary report clearly marks specific issues and links them to validation rules, greatly simplifying the cumbersome process of cross-file review. easeP21 particularly refine the management of split domain issues, precisely delineating them to specific datasets (such as FAAE and FACE), ensuring the continuity and traceability of review conclusions across different versions, thus surpassing the limitations of traditional P21 reports and significantly enhancing the consistency and reliability of the reports.\nWith its innovative classification technology and the unique data processing capabilities of R, easeP21 has greatly optimized the clinical data review process, offering new insights for clinical trial data management."
